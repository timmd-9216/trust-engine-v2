# Contributor Guidance

We are a collaborative organization focused on building meaningful projects with AI and data. Our main mission is to fight misinformation in news and social media, while also exploring creative domains such as music and visual art through AI. We value curiosity, initiative, and people who enjoy learning by building.

If you care about misinformation, like working in Python, and enjoy experimenting with ideas, you’ll fit in well with our way of working.

## What We Value

We’re less interested in perfect proposals and more interested in thoughtful ideas and motivated contributors. We appreciate:

- Passion for addressing misinformation and its social impact
- A hands-on, experimental mindset
- Clear communication and openness to discussion
- Interest in AI, data, and modeling (at any level)

“Vibe coders” are welcome. If you think best by building, testing, and iterating, that’s a plus.

## What to Include in Your Proposal

Keep things clear and focused. A strong proposal usually includes:

- **Why you’re interested**
  Tell us what motivates you to work on misinformation, AI, or data-driven projects.
- **What you want to build**
  Describe your idea or direction. This doesn’t need to be final — projects naturally evolve.
- **How you’d approach it**
  A high-level view of tools, data, or techniques you’d like to use is enough.
- **What success looks like**
  Share what you’d like to deliver by the end of the program (a tool, prototype, dataset, analysis, etc.).
- **A bit about you**
  Relevant experience, interests, and links to past work (GitHub, notebooks, projects) if you have them.

## Communication & Collaboration

We encourage contributors to reach out early, ask questions, and share ideas. We work through open discussion and regular feedback, and we enjoy shaping projects together as they develop. You’ll be supported, challenged, and encouraged to grow throughout the process.

## Final Notes

We care about impact, responsible use of AI, and building things that others can reuse and learn from. If fighting misinformation matters to you and you enjoy experimenting with AI and data in a collaborative environment, we’d be excited to see your proposal.
